# audit

Read-only verb. Produces a per-file migration plan: source → canonical destination → action. The plan is what `/acw-instance upgrade` executes. The audit verb itself writes nothing to the workspace; optional absorption candidates to ACW's `_buffer/` are surfaced in the plan and only written on operator confirmation during plan review.

## Mental model

ACW is the gold standard for substrate shape. This verb's job is to look at the workspace's substrate, identify what's already canonical, what needs to migrate into canonical, what's genuinely workspace-specific, and what's a candidate for upstream absorption — then state all of that as one coherent plan.

The verb does NOT interrogate the operator per-finding. It uses canonical knowledge to make sensible routing calls and presents the full plan in one pass. Interactive prompting is reserved for genuinely ambiguous cases, flagged `[?]` in the plan.

This supersedes the v0.4.0 / v0.5.0 interactive Mode B walk. Today's workspaces (post-v0.6.0 absorption of the cockpit cluster — `briefings/`, `runbooks/`, `integrations/`, `context/`, `inbox/`, `_buffer/`) usually require few or zero `[?]` rows.

## After the spine

The orchestrator's Step 5 produces the migration plan structure. Audit's job is to fill it in fully and print it.

## Plan construction

Walk the in-scope substrate from Step 4 of the spine. For each file or directory, classify and route per the action enum in `SKILL.md`. The default reasoning model:

1. **Is this already canonical-shape at the canonical location?** → `leave-untouched`.
2. **Is the content right but the location wrong?** → `move` to canonical destination.
3. **Is the location right but the format wrong?** → `reshape` in place to canonical format.
4. **Does the content belong inside an existing canonical destination?** → `merge` into that destination.
5. **Is canonical missing entirely?** → `write-canonical` from template.
6. **Is the file an empty placeholder or byte-identical scaffold artifact never used?** → `delete`.
7. **Is the substrate-shaped pattern uniquely this workspace's domain, won't generalize upstream?** → `instance-specific` (record rationale; declaration goes in `acw-state.yaml::instance_specific_substrate` with decision-log entry).
8. **Is the substrate-shaped pattern net-new (ACW lacks the canonical shape) or judged better than canonical?** → `absorption-candidate`.
9. **Cannot decide between two reasonable routings?** → `[?]` with the candidate options inline.

The verb is opinionated. After v0.6.0 absorbed the cockpit cluster, well-formed substrate should route cleanly. Use `[?]` sparingly.

## Canonical comparison reference

Authoritative source: canonical `acw-state.yaml::instance_layer` (each row names its template), `template_layer` (each path names the canonical rule or tool), and the `decision_tracking.*` / `glossary.*` blocks (frontmatter required, status/kind enums). The skill does not redeclare per-type shape inline.

For each in-scope path, fetch the canonical source named by its row and compare. The comparison is mechanical:

- File at canonical location AND matches the canonical template/format → `leave-untouched`.
- File present but format differs (frontmatter, sections, ids, append-only structure) → `reshape`.
- File missing entirely → `write-canonical` (render from the template named in `instance_layer`).
- File at wrong location → `move`.

**Wiki mode is canonical (v0.9.8+, D-ACW-048).** If `decisions/decision-log.md` or `glossary.md` (single-file legacy shape) is detected, emit a mandatory `reshape` plan row that migrates the file to wiki shape via `tools/migrate_to_wiki.py`. Not an `[?]` ambiguous row — the migration is required, not optional. The audit also emits `write-canonical` rows for `decisions/INDEX.md` and `glossary/INDEX.md` if they don't yet exist alongside the legacy single-file source.

## Migration manifest pass (v0.10.0+)

Authoritative source: `rules/migration-manifest.md` (schema) + the YAML files under canonical `migrations/`. Execution behavior in `references/upgrade.md` § "Step kind execution detail."

The audit reads the workspace's current ACW version (`acw-state.yaml::last_reconciled_version`, or `pre-acw` if no state file exists) and chains the relevant migration manifests in version order. For each manifest in the chain:

1. **Read the manifest.** Pull `from_version`, `to_version`, `prerequisites`, `operator_prompts`, `steps`.
2. **Evaluate `prerequisites`.** Each prerequisite is a step-kind in the manifest schema (`clean_working_tree`, `minimum_version`, etc.). If any prerequisite fails, abort plan generation and surface the failure as a halt condition. The plan-approval gate is not reached.
3. **Collect operator-prompt entries.** Each entry in `operator_prompts` becomes a `[?]` resolution row at the TOP of the plan, in declared order. Each row carries the prompt text, the `enum` or `type`, the `default`, and the `affects` mapping. These are answered at plan-approval time, before any `only_if` evaluation.
4. **Resolve `only_if` predicates.** With operator-prompt answers in hand (defaults applied if the operator was not prompted in chain-mode), walk every step. For each step with an `only_if` predicate, evaluate per the predicate forms documented in upgrade.md. Steps whose predicate evaluates `false` produce NO plan rows. Steps whose predicate evaluates `true` (or have no `only_if`) proceed to row generation.
5. **Generate plan rows per step.** Map each step kind to the plan-row action per the table in upgrade.md ("How manifests map to existing plan-row actions"). Group multi-move `git_mv` steps into one row group so a single failure surfaces cleanly. For `git_mv` moves with `optional: true`, emit the row tagged `[would-skip-if-absent]` so the operator can see the planned no-op cases.
6. **Append manifest summary to plan.** At the end of the manifest's row block, print:

   ```
   ─── Manifest: 0.9.9-to-0.10.0.yaml (authority: D-ACW-050) ───
     Operator prompts: <N>  (resolved at plan-approval time)
     Steps planned:    <N>
     Steps skipped by only_if: <N>
     Optional moves that will no-op (source absent): <N>
   ```

Chain mode: when the workspace is multiple versions behind (e.g., `0.9.7 → 0.10.0`), the audit reads each manifest in version order (`0.9.7-to-0.9.8.yaml`, `0.9.8-to-0.9.9.yaml`, `0.9.9-to-0.10.0.yaml`), emitting each manifest's rows in chain order. Operator prompts from earlier manifests surface first. The audit does NOT actually advance state between manifests — it evaluates prerequisites for each against the state the previous manifest WOULD HAVE produced, conservatively (if the previous manifest's `update_acw_state` would set `version: 0.9.8`, the next manifest's `minimum_version: 0.9.8` is considered satisfied).

When an intermediate manifest file is missing from canonical (e.g., `0.9.7-to-0.9.8.yaml` not yet authored), the audit falls back to the version-specific sections in upgrade.md (v0.5.0 / v0.9.7 / v0.9.8) for that hop, then resumes manifest-driven mode at the next available `from_version`. Missing intermediate manifests are surfaced in the plan header as a one-line note so the operator knows fallback paths fired.

For unregistered workspaces being adopted (no `acw-state.yaml`), the entry point is `migrations/pre-acw-to-0.10.0.yaml`. The audit detects substrate-shaped signals (per the spine), confirms adoption is appropriate, then runs the pre-acw manifest's prompts and step generation in the same way.

Rule files that govern specific substrate shapes (consumed by this verb when classifying):

- `rules/decision-tracking.md` — decisions format, both modes.
- `rules/task-tracking.md` — tasks-status shape (Pending-only canonical since v0.9.3).
- `rules/manifest-discipline.md` — `acw-state.yaml` structure + canonical-default-paths table.
- `rules/instance-current-manifest.md` — recommended-blocks registry (consumed by next section).
- `rules/auto-load-discipline.md` — auto-load gating (consumed by Auto-load discipline section).
- `rules/skill-format.md` — skill frontmatter + body shape.
- `rules/incident-tracking.md` — `incidents.jsonl` schema.
- `rules/substrate-boundary.md` — in-scope / out-of-scope partition.

Differences become plan rows per the action enum.

## Recommended-blocks registry pass

Walk every entry in the fetched canonical `rules/instance-current-manifest.md`. For each entry:

- Compare earned-in version against `acw-state.yaml::last_reconciled_version`. If earned-in ≤ last_reconciled_version, skip (already reconciled).
- If earned-in > last_reconciled_version, check the workspace's `acw-state.yaml`:
  - **Block absent** → plan row: `write-canonical` on `acw-state.yaml` (add proposed default block).
  - **Block present-but-empty** (`block: []`) → operator deliberately opted out; skip silently.
  - **Block present and populated** → already declared; skip.
  - **Block malformed** (wrong shape) → `[?]` plan row, ask operator to confirm intent.

Each plan row carries the registry entry's "How to add" content as the proposed default.

## Substrate-shaped pattern walk

For each in-scope substrate-shaped file or directory NOT covered by canonical types:

- Apply the default reasoning model above. Most cases route cleanly to one of `move` (rename into canonical destination), `reshape` (rewrite in canonical format at canonical destination), `instance-specific`, or `absorption-candidate`.
- If a file's path is suggestive of a canonical type (`my-decisions.md`, `team-todo.md`, `wiki/`, `kb/`, etc.) → propose the canonical mapping, route as `move` or `reshape`.
- If a file looks like a near-clone of a recently-absorbed v0.6.0 surface (briefings, runbooks, integrations, context, inbox) → route to that canonical destination.
- If genuinely ambiguous → `[?]` with proposed alternatives.

## Skills audit

For each subdirectory under `skills/` not marked `status: superseded`:

- Validate `SKILL.md` per `rules/skill-format.md` (frontmatter fields, classification table, body structure).
- Validate `gotchas.md` exists with at least one entry; if missing, plan row: `write-canonical` on `skills/<name>/gotchas.md` with stub content.
- For orchestrators with command tables, validate every command has a matching `references/<command>.md` that does not redeclare the spine.

Skill-shape findings become plan rows under the skill's path; default action is `reshape` for fixable frontmatter/structure issues, `write-canonical` for missing files.

## Auto-load discipline (earned in v0.9.0)

Authoritative source: `rules/auto-load-discipline.md`. The rule enumerates canonical recommendations (with mode-portable variants for decisions and glossary surfaces) and declared demotion candidates. The skill fetches the rule and applies its lists; it does not carry a copy.

For each entry in the workspace's `acw-state.yaml::auto_load_at_session_start`, classify against the rule and add to the migration plan:

| Verdict | Trigger | Plan action |
|---|---|---|
| `KEEP` | Entry on canonical recommendations list, declared structured form | leave-untouched |
| `KEEP (migrate-to-structured)` | Entry on canonical recommendations list, bare-path legacy form | reshape — convert to structured form with the canonical claim |
| `KEEP (instance-specific)` | Entry not on canonical list, declared structured form with operator-supplied claim | leave-untouched |
| `DEMOTE` | Entry on declared demotion list (any form) | reshape `acw-state.yaml::auto_load_at_session_start` — remove the entry; file itself stays in workspace |
| `REVIEW` | Entry not on canonical list, bare-path legacy form (no declared claim) | `[?]` plan row — operator confirms keep (with structured claim) or demote |

If the workspace's `acw-state.yaml::auto_load_at_session_start` block is in legacy bare-path form entirely, propose ONE consolidated `reshape` plan row that migrates the whole block to structured form with verdicts applied per entry. This avoids N small plan rows for each entry.

If `rules/auto-load-discipline.md` is absent from the workspace's `rules/` directory, propose `write-canonical` per the recommended-blocks registry pass (the rule earned in v0.9.0; instances at `last_reconciled_version` < 0.9.0 will see this as drift).

Plan output format extension — add a new section after "Skills compliance":

```
Auto-load discipline (vs rules/auto-load-discipline.md):
  Current entries: <N>   form: <all-structured | all-legacy | mixed>
  Verdicts:
    KEEP                           : <N>
    KEEP (migrate-to-structured)   : <N>
    KEEP (instance-specific)       : <N>
    DEMOTE                         : <N>
    REVIEW                         : <N>
  Per-entry detail:
    <path>   form: <structured | bare-legacy>   verdict: <KEEP | KEEP (migrate-to-structured) | KEEP (instance-specific) | DEMOTE | REVIEW>   reason: <one-line>
```

The audit verb does not write to `acw-state.yaml`. Demotions and migrations execute under `/acw-instance upgrade`'s single approval gate.

## Host entry file shape (Claude Code) — v0.9.7 audit

Authoritative source: `rules/instance-current-manifest.md` § "Host entry file shape (Claude Code) — v0.9.7" + the v0.9.7 canonical templates (`tools/templates/load-context.py.tmpl`, `tools/templates/settings.json.tmpl`).

Run only when `CLAUDE.md` exists at workspace root (presence is the trigger for Claude Code-host detection — `host` is not currently a key in `acw-state.yaml`). Instances without a Claude Code entry file skip this pass; their host-specific equivalent runs when an adapter ships. The pass evaluates three coupled artifacts against canonical:

| Artifact | Expected canonical shape |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` (root) | Body = exactly `See AGENTS.md.\n`. No `@`-imports, no auto-load list, no project-substrate section. |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Present. Contains `hooks.SessionStart` array with at least one entry whose `matcher` includes `startup` and whose `hooks[].command` invokes `.claude/hooks/load-context.py`. |
| `.claude/hooks/load-context.py` | Present. Content matches canonical template at `tools/templates/load-context.py.tmpl` (whole-file equality check, comments and all). |

Plus a fourth check on AGENTS.md content:

| Artifact | Expected canonical shape |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | Directive 7 names the SessionStart hook (not `@`-imports). Contains a section heading `## Auto-load (Resource / When / Why)`. Contains a section heading `## What NOT to Load`. |

For each artifact, the verdict is one of:

| Verdict | Trigger | Plan action |
|---|---|---|
| `KEEP` | Matches canonical exactly | leave-untouched (no plan row emitted) |
| `RESHAPE` | `CLAUDE.md` body has more than one line, or carries `@`-imports | reshape — overwrite `CLAUDE.md` with `See AGENTS.md.\n` |
| `WRITE-CANONICAL` | `.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/hooks/load-context.py` absent | write-canonical from `tools/templates/{settings.json,load-context.py}.tmpl` |
| `RESHAPE` (settings.json) | Present but missing SessionStart hook or pointing at a different command | reshape — merge canonical hook block into existing settings (preserve other hook entries the operator has added; reshape only the SessionStart array) |
| `RESHAPE` (load-context.py) | Present but content drifts from canonical template | reshape — overwrite with canonical template content |
| `RESHAPE` (AGENTS.md) | Directive 7 still names `@`-imports OR sections missing | reshape — apply the canonical edits (directive-7 rewrite, add Resource/When/Why table, add What NOT to Load table). Operator-supplied content elsewhere in AGENTS.md preserved. |

Skip the entire pass if `acw-state.yaml::last_reconciled_version >= 0.9.7` AND all four artifacts match canonical (already migrated). Print one summary line in that case: `Host entry file (Claude Code): v0.9.7 shape current.`

If pre-v0.9.7 shape detected, emit plan rows under their normal action sections in the migration plan, plus a summary block:

```
Host entry file (Claude Code) — v0.9.7 migration:
  CLAUDE.md            : <KEEP | RESHAPE>
  .claude/settings.json: <KEEP | WRITE-CANONICAL | RESHAPE>
  .claude/hooks/load-context.py: <KEEP | WRITE-CANONICAL | RESHAPE>
  AGENTS.md            : <KEEP | RESHAPE>
```

The pass is mechanical; no `[?]` rows expected. If the operator has manually customized `.claude/settings.json` with additional hooks (commit hooks, statusline, etc.), the canonical reshape preserves them — only the SessionStart array is rewritten.

## Optional patterns (earn-by-discipline)

Some canonical patterns are NOT scaffolded by default — they ship to instances that earn them through operator discipline. The audit verb surfaces these as opt-in proposals; operator accepts or declines during plan review.

### context/contacts/ — wiki-shaped CRM

When `<workspace>/context/contacts/` is absent, emit one optional plan row:

```
opt-in (context/contacts/):
  - context/contacts/INDEX.md  — wiki-shaped contacts surface (template: tools/templates/context-contacts-INDEX.md.tmpl)
    rationale: per-contact CRM file with merge/dedupe discipline. Wiki shape: INDEX + entries/<slug>.md per contact.
    accept? [y/N]
```

If the operator accepts at plan-review time, upgrade writes:

- `context/contacts/INDEX.md` from `tools/templates/context-contacts-INDEX.md.tmpl`
- `context/contacts/entries/.gitkeep`

If declined → no write; no plan row carries forward. The opt-in re-surfaces on the next audit run until accepted or explicitly declared `instance-specific` (operator-declined in `acw-state.yaml`).

If `<workspace>/context/contacts/` already exists in wiki shape → `leave-untouched`, no opt-in emitted. If it exists in some other shape → standard `reshape` plan row applies.

## Meta-layer staleness (conditional)

Run only if `acw-state.yaml::meta_layer` is present and non-empty. For each file listed in `meta_layer`, evaluate the trigger table from `skills/acw-session/references/end.md` § "Meta-layer maintenance" against `last_reconciled_version`. Stale files become plan rows with action `reshape` and the proposed edit inline.

If `meta_layer` is absent or empty, skip silently.

## Migration-plan output format

```

## Plan persistence

Audit does not persist the plan to disk. The plan is reproducible: `/acw-instance upgrade` re-runs the spine and rebuilds the plan from the same inputs. This avoids stale-plan-on-disk failure modes.

If the operator wants the plan saved (for review, sharing, or later execution), they can capture the chat output manually. A future earn-by-incident may add `--save-plan <path>` if persistence becomes load-bearing.

## When NOT to fire (verb-specific)

- Workspace has no substrate at all (orchestrator Step 2 bails first).
- Operator wants only canonical comparison and not pattern walk (not currently supported as a flag; future earn-by-incident if requested).

## Output

Migration plan to chat. Zero writes to the workspace. Zero writes to ACW's `_buffer/` (absorption candidates are proposed, not yet written; the upgrade verb writes them on plan execution).
