# integrations/

This directory holds documentation about external systems this workspace talks to: APIs, MCP servers, adapters, webhooks, anything that lives outside the workspace and exchanges data with it.

## What goes here

- One subdirectory per external system, named by the system: `integrations/zoho-desk/`, `integrations/slack-mcp/`, `integrations/google-calendar/`, `integrations/stripe-api/`.
- Inside each subdirectory: docs about that integration. Authentication, endpoints, rate limits, payload schemas, gotchas, runbooks for setup and troubleshooting.
- Or, if the integration is small enough, a single markdown file at the root: `integrations/<system-name>.md`.

## What does NOT go here

- Skills that USE the integration → `skills/`.
- Configuration / secrets → environment variables or your secret store, never in this directory.
- Long-lived data extracted from the integration → wherever that data belongs in your substrate (decisions, glossary, etc.), not here.

This directory documents *how* the workspace talks to external systems. Operational use of those systems happens through skills.

## Organization is operator-driven

ACW canonical doesn't enforce structure beyond this README's existence. Each operator decides per-workspace how to organize integration docs. If a single workspace has two integrations, two subdirectories or two files is fine. If it has thirty, the operator can add their own grouping conventions.

When in doubt: one directory per integration, README.md per directory describing that integration's purpose and how to set it up.
